mapper-
	map(<row....../>) ---> (hour, 1) where the hour is extracted from the Creation Date

reducer-
	reducer(hour, List[1,1,1.......]) ----> (hour,sum(List))






As we can see from the graph that there is increase in post at around 15 in the stack overflow data.

Maximum user activity/per hour is at hour 15 = 3916
Lowest user activity/perhour is at hour 03 = 1346

Ratio of activities = 3916/1346 = 2.9

Yes there is an oppourtunity for cloud deployment because there is increase in activity till 15 hours then it will decrease so if they will have more servers at this time it will be a lot better for them.
